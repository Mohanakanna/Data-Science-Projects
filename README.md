## Project Description
The problem statement provided by hospital was to analyze  data to identify domains to be focused to improve the patient satisfactions,offer discounts and to check discrimination if any. The tasks involved:

- Cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Analyzing the cleaned data using different charts.
- Creating a dashboard to visualize the insights.
- Formulating strategies and suggestions for increasing the patients visit,satisfaction and maintaining the standards.
## Data Cleaning
The raw data provided had several inconsistencies and missing values that needed to be addressed. The following steps were taken:

- **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate entries were identified and removed to prevent skewed analysis.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were either filled with appropriate measures (mean, median, mode) or excluded based on the context.
- **Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensured uniformity in data representation, such as numerical values, and categorical data.
## Data Analysis
The cleaned data was then analyzed using pivot tables in Excel. Key metrics and dimensions considered included:

- **Department Analysis:** Analysis of departments by no of patients to identify domains with high and low people's densities and to know the  doctor requirements.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Examining the patient's demographics like age,gender etc... to know  which demographics utilize healthcare services the most..
- **Price Range Analysis:** Evaluating the average price range,visits of departments to determine demand of the departments.
- **Rating:** Analyzing patients ratings and reviews to assess departments performance and customer satisfaction.
## Dashboard
A dynamic dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the key findings. The dashboard includes:

- **Main tab:** Shows hospitals overall metrics like the number of daily visits, revenue produced on that day, customer satisfaction, how busy are different departments on that day, and general waiting time on that day. This tab should have a slicer of date.
- **Doctor's tab:** Shows individual doctor’s performance metrics like customer satisfaction, the number of patients he was visited by, the revenue he has generated, and his appointment fees. This tab should have a slicer of the Doctor's Name or ID.
- **Patient's tab:**  customer’s profile which would involve metrics like the most frequently visited department, their age, their race, their waiting time, number of visits, the total amount that they have paid to the hospital, etc. All the metrics using which they can address the patient very carefully in their visits. This tab should have a slicer of the Patient's Name or ID.
## Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were made:

- **Doctors requirement :** Identified specific departments with high no of patients but less doctors , suggesting necessary departments for hiring doctors.
- **Demographics:** Demographics analysis shows no discrimination on patients by their age,race and gender which will increase the hospital popularity.
- **Discount requirements:** Different discounts are provided to patients based on their type, total bill, and department, with extra consideration for inpatients' financial urgency and critical condition.
## Conclusion
This data analysis project provides a comprehensive overview of Columbia Asia Hospital's department condtion,requiremnets and offers strategic recommendations for future development. By leveraging data cleaning and  analysis in PowerBI, valuable insights were uncovered to guide decision-making for developing hospital condition.
